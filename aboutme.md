I am an enthusiastic data scientist with a background in Environmental Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, and Microbiology. I love to solve real-world problems using my new acquired tools such as Machine Learning and my domain knowledge accumulated through the years. I believe in developing a long-term work relationship and a people-first culture when working in a team environment. I am constantly on the lookout for new ideas, creative opportunities. 


When I am not at work, I take care of my 6-yr old sweetheart who constantly praises me the best mom in the world (the worst, occasionally). She keeps me grounded. When I do find time to indulge myself, I would go hiking, heirloom gardening, kick scootering, or pick up some reading and sipping hot cocoa on a rainy day.


My daily mantra: “Stay humble, stay curious.”
