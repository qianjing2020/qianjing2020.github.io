A documentary by Wang Jiuliang, **Plastic China** (2016) [![Plastic China](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OJrVYB15aFA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJrVYB15aFA), revealed the reality of the plastic waste industry in China.  
In the documentary, the worker sorting the plastic waste without any personal protection equipment, risking having their skin punctured by discarded medical plastic equipment. Unattended children playing on the plastic waste hill and pick up things to play unknowing that some are tremendously dangerous to their life.

"Plastics are hard to sort. There are hundreds of them, something Polyester, something polychlorine, something benzene, something polyoxymethylene. Experienced worker light them up and can tell by the burning smell," says old worker Yu in the documentary,   
"..., you can find almost any disgusting things among the discarded plastic waste: spoiled meat with fly larvae, ragged dirty socks, stinking dried up spoiled milk. I know this poor 70 year old grandma, who burned her fingers emptying an unlabeled container with Hydrofluoric acid in it. And some are waste metal that contains radioactive materials beyond safe level." 


So, how bad is the situation, how much plastic do we produce per year, where do they go? which sector produces most plastic waste, How are they traded globally?  There are so many questions to be answered and big data to gather. I looked into the data I found from [our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/) and here are some interesting plot I generated in Python. Hopefully by doing and sharing it, we can look straight at the problem and take actions to deviate from this self-destruction course for human race.
